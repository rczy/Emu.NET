# Emu.NET

This repository is a collection of my future emulator projects written in C# for the .NET platform.

My current goal is to learn the C# language and the tools used for developing applications for the .NET ecosystem.

## Projects

- **6502 CPU:** The `CPU6502` and `CPU6502.Test` projects contains the source code and tests for 6502 CPU emulation.

## Future plans
- Z80 CPU
- Atari 2600 Console
- Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)
- Commodore 64 (C64)
